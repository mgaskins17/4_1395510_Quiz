# 4_1395510_Quiz

## Description

I wanted to create a quiz that will challenge my TA's whether they actually know basic JavaScript knowledge. I decided upon a quiz because I honestly thought it would be easy, BUT I WAS WRONG! Holy crap, I learned this project that Google is my friend!

The problem that was solved was more of closing the gap in my overall knowledge and allowing me to use skills I've learned so far. I learned different techniques and how JavaScript can complete almost 90% if not 100% of this project if you're sufficient enough. The skills I learnt from my previous projects I employed here with formatting and such, but actually diving deep into the JavaScript by actually allowing the webpage to take in actions was amazing. Targeting different event listeners and how to utilize buttons, inputs and such was a awesome feeling.

## Installation

This project is uploaded to Github Pages, and I provided the link to it. Everything is loaded, and there are no other steps needed to use this application. You'll be prompted to start the quiz once loading the application.

## Usage & Tests

I will give a couple different test cases to show I've met the criteria.

1. The application will load up and you have the option of clicking the start button or the view highscores in the top left

2. You will be timed during the quiz, as you get answers wrong the time will be reduced by 15 seconds. You start out with 100 seconds.

3. Once you finish the quiz, you will be prompted to input your initials and your high score will be recorded. If you wish, you can clear the high score on the high score menu.

4. If you run out of time, you will see a screen stating so then you can return back to the start quiz menu.

5. You're allowed to take the quiz as many times as needed unti you get a 100.

**** Please view the images in the (assets/screenshots) folder

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
